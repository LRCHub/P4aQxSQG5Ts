こっちの心根量らずと、
一体如何云(どうい)う御了見
そうした喧嘩は手前から、
売ってやりんす上等よ
待てこら 未だ答えは
聞けちゃ居ないのさ
洗い浚い吐け 今宵は常套句なんて
通用しないと思え
I'm so angry with you, sorry.
You should concentrate
on cheering me up.
But it's too late now,
you've lost your chance,
it's gone.
You never once realized
how bad our dilemma had got.
Stop it, honey, cheeky!
Why can't you see it my way
just this time?
Silence, naughty, fussy!
I am really
sick(so) sick(so)
sick of you.
And I hate you.
That's right you love me
so much, don't you.
I should thank you for that,
maybe.
But it's no use
how what a giant waste of time.
Because I have never felt
any weight in your words to me.
(Shut Shut Shut)
Shut up!!
Stop it, honey, snooty!
Why don't we just look at
our bullshit then?
Iffy, crappy, scrappy!
You would be best off (far far)
alone.
I am really
sick(so) sick(so)
sick of you.
And I hate you.
